# NM-project - CURRICULUM VITAE GENERATOR

The code generates a Curriculum Vitae (CV) document using the docx library. It takes in personal information, education details, work experience, and skills as input data. The create_cv function formats this data into sections within the document, such as Personal Information, Education, Work Experience, and Skills. Each section is structured with appropriate headings and content, providing a clear and organized CV layout. Finally, the generated CV is saved as a Word document named "generated_cv.docx".
